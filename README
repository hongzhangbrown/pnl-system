Synopsis:
	 This project is written in Python 2.7.  It takes in fill and price
	messages and outputs the PNL messages for each stock. 
	
Getting Started:
	 The project consists of two data files and three "*.py" files.
	The two data files contain the input fill messages and prices messages
	respectively.  Among the three "*.py" files,  "main.py" and "test_pnl.py" are
	executable, while the "pnl.py" is the main module. 

   	 The "pnl.py" file defines three classes: StockTracker, PNLTracker, and
	MessageDispatcher.  MessageDispatcher reads in the input file and parses the
	data into fill and price messages.  Each StockTracker object stores and updates
	information of a stock, including its position and associated cash.  PNLTracker
	maintains a set of StockTracker objects and is responsible for handling incoming
	messages. It interfaces with StockTracker objects to update stock positions or
	print out p&l information with each incoming message.

	 The test file "test_pnl.py" contains test cases for StockTracker and
	PNLTracker.

Running the project:
	 To run "main.py": ./main
	 To run the test file:./test_pnl.py
